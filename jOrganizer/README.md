# jOrganizer - Organize your daily needs!

## Configuration


## Running the application
Just type the following line into your favorite shell (__bash/zsh__ are recommended) and the application will run:

    java -jar jOrganizer.jar

The application starts with the default (minimal) configuration. If you are interested in further features and functions, you should provide an own configuration file (see the aforementioned example). You can also simply copy the `full.properties` file inside of __jOrganizer.jar__ and alter the configuration. Save this file somewhere and type the following line:

    java -jar jOrganizer.jar <pathToConfigFile>
